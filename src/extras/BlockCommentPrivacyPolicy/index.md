This is the privacy policy for the *BlockComment* application that runs on macOS and provides a BlockComment
extension Apple Xcode development environment. The extension generates _smart_ comments containing information
taken from Swift source code.

The app and this policy were created by Brad Howes.

### What information does the *Application* obtain and how is it used?

Neither the *BlockComment* app nor the Xcode extension it contains collect any information from the user.
However, the macOS platform on which the application is runs _may_ collect information about your usage of the
app. Please see [the Apple Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/) for specifics. I may
receive from Apple app usage metrics, including crash reports. However, I will not know anything about the user
running the _BlockComment_ application.

### Does the _BlockComment_ app collect real time location information of the device?

No. The _BlockComment_ app does not monitor -- much less collect -- information about the location of your macOS
device.

### Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by _BlockComment_?

No. Simply put, _BlockComment_ cannot share what it does not collect.

### Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information

As there is no collection of data, there is likewise no retention, and thus no means to manage what is not being
collected.
