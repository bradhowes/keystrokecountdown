This is the privacy policy for the *SoundFonts* application that runs on iOS mobile devices. It is an
application that generates audio using sound font files. The app and this policy were created by Brad Howes.

### What information does the *Application* obtain and how is it used?

*SoundFonts* does not collect any information from the user. However, the iOS platform on which the application
is built _may_ collect information about your usage of the app. Please see [the Apple Privacy
Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/) for specifics. I may receive from Apple app usage metrics,
including crash reports. However, I will not know anything about the user running the _SoundFonts_ application.

### Does the _SoundFonts_ app collect real time location information of the device?

No. The _SoundFonts_ app does not monitor -- much less collect -- information about the location of your mobile
device.

### Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by _SoundFonts_?

No. Simply put, _SoundFonts_ cannot share what it does not collect.

### Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information

As there is no collection of data, there is likewise no retention, and thus no means to manage what is not being
collected.
