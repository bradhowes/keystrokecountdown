This is the privacy policy for the *SimplyLowPass* application and AUv3 app extension that runs on iOS and macOS
devices. The *app extension* is an audio effects filter that operates on audio signals. The *app* is simply a
way to distribute the *app extension* and to demonstrate its operation. The *app*, the *app extension*, and this
policy were created by B-Ray Software.

### What information does the *application* or *app extension* obtain and how is it used?

*SimplyLowPass* does not collect any information from the user. However, the iOS and macOS platforms _may_
collect information about your usage of the *app* and/or *app extension*. Please see [the Apple Privacy
Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/) for specifics. I may receive from Apple usage metrics,
including crash reports. However, I will not know anything about the user running the _SimplyLowPass_
application.

### Does the *SimplyLowPass* *app* or *app extension* collect real time location information of the device?

No. The *SimplyLowPass* *app* and *app extension* do not monitor -- much less collect -- information about the
location of your device.

### Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by *SimplyLowPass*?

No. Simply put, *SimplyLowPass* cannot share what it does not collect.

### Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information

As there is no collection of data, there is likewise no retention, and thus no means to manage what is not being
collected.
